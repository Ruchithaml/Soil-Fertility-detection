# Soil-Fertility-detection
   Soil plays very important role not only in agriculture, but also many other areas like construction,
arts, fuel and some even used as beauty products. Mainly, if we consider agriculture, nutrients and
minerals like nitrogen, carbon , potassium,sulphur etc and many other salts are important to decide
for a soil to be fertile. This is decided along with ph value[power of hydrogen] to find acidity and
electro-conductivity{ec}. EC correlates and tells the rate of salt presence.
     This project mainly focuses on finding and predicting the fertility of soil based on major components 
like nitrogen(N), phosphorous(P), potassium(K), ph and electro-conductivity(ec). 
     Here we use decision-tree and randomforest(classification & regression), confusion matrix algorithms
to display the result of test and train data. Histogram and piechart are used to represent the components.
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    
Note: The code is taken from the internet and other sources. And I modified it according to my requirements.
